AI Home Gym Trainer

🌟 What it is:

An AI-powered portable gym assistant that analyzes your workouts with your phone or a compact device and gives real-time feedback (like "Straighten your back", "Squat deeper", "Good tempo!").

Think Peloton + Personal Trainer + AI Computer Vision, but much cheaper and portable.


🔥 Why it can make $1M:

Fitness is a $100B+ market — people always want to get fitter.
AI + Fitness = trendy (perfect for Kickstarter users).
Affordable personal training without needing expensive gyms.
Visual, emotional videos can go super viral (show real people transforming at home).


🛠️ MVP (minimum viable product):

Phone app + small stand (or smart mirror version later).
AI model (based on OpenPose / MediaPipe) tracks your joints and posture.
Pre-built workout programs (strength, yoga, rehab, etc.).
Real-time voice + text feedback.
Progress reports after workouts.
